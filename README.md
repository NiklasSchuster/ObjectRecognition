*python main.py*  

**How do I access the backend?**

Swagger is visible on: localhost:5000/docs

Either via the swagger, 1 example image request is already prepared in the swagger console or you use the client.py file. Change the image name in the client.py and execute *python client.py* to send the base64 encoded image.
